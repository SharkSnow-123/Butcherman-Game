How to play the game!

So, this is hangman with a twist.

Prologue:

A young man decided to meet with an old friend during his college days.
He did not know that was his worst decision.

You will be given clues by the person who kidnapped you, answer it correctly, and your life will be spared!
Simple. Right?

3 days. One room. One game.

Good luck, and enjoy!

/// NOTE:

This is our final project in Data Structures & Algorthims though, for now, a lot of parts in our game are a bit buggy and are work in progress. However, we promise, once we're finished with our DSA.
We would like to focus more on this game and give our best to making it a full functioning game, for now, we have deadlines that messes up our time.
So, after we're done with our parts, our goal on this would be beautifying the GUI, expanding the storyline, adding another gamemode, and many more!

This was really fun, hectic, and confusing at times, but honestly? This would be something I'd reminisce about.

/// END OF NOTE.
